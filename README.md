# GeometrySpace
Made a simple mobile game with Unity &amp; published it on play store. You're playing a rocket and you must collect as many yellow circles ("stars") as possible in space. On Github, you can only find Assets &amp; Packages (not all complete folders available here because GitHub seems to miss the support of Unity :p).
